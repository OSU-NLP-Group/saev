**S**parse **a**uto**e**ncoders (SAEs) for **v**ision transformers (ViTs), implemented in PyTorch.

## Installation

Installation is supported with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).
saev will likely work with pure pip, conda, etc. but I will not formally support it.

Clone this repository, then from the root directory:

```bash
uv run python -m saev --help
```

This will create a virtual environment and display the CLI help.

## Why saev?

There are plenty of alternative libraries for SAEs:

- [Overcomplete](https://github.com/KempnerInstitute/overcomplete), primarily developed by [Thomas Fel](https://thomasfel.me).
